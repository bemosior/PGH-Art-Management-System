Originally launched in Fall, 2015, The Sankofa Series marks an expansion of the project. The Sankofa principle symbolizes bringing the past into the present—that in order to move forward, we must first look back. In this photoessay, historic photos will be collected from albums belonging to families across Pittsburgh. Paired with similarly themed contemporary candid photos, the goal of the work is to spark a conversation about the evolution of black womanhood in Pittsburgh, and consequently in the United States in general.",

The warm heart of electric artifice is cozy and safe.  I'm ignorant of the true source of that warmth.  Must be that stinky power plant out there somewhere. I'd sort of like to know, but they don't give tours.  And I have more trivial concerns, like cardboard spaceships.",

It’s almost a forgotten element until we realize that it is integral to how we go about our lives in an ever more technologically driven world. This month, the American Jewish Museum has partnered with artist Lori Hepner to create a series of interactive workshops that take advantage of the neon of the now, LEDs, to draw with light in unexpected ways. Taking inspiration from the light based work in the AJM’s Jane Haskell: Drawing in Light retrospective and Lori Hepner has devised a series of pieces to allow the public to help craft an exhibition at Assemble that will evolve over the course of a month.",
